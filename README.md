JavaScript Refresher Repository

This repository is my self taught refresher course on JavaScript.  I haven't touched JavaScript in a long time, probably not since leaving University.  I'd like to brush up on my front end skills as almost every Java developer role now looks for "Full Stack Developers".  Prior to strengthening my React and Angular, I thought I'd go back and revisit pure JavaScript.
